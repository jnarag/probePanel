    "Use method: `process_gb` to process non-segmented viruses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method takes five parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `gb_file`: string; name of genbank file for a specific virus family or genera\n",
    "2. `working_dir`: string; file path of where you want to save fasta output files\n",
    "3. `virus_family`: string; name of virus family or genera\n",
    "4. `min_length`: int; the minimum sequence length for extracting sequences (shorter sequences will be excluded\n",
    "5. `host_taxafile`: name of text file containing taxonomic names of host of interests e.g. rodentia or shrews.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _Segmented viruses_\n",
    "\n",
    "For segmented viruses, used method: `process_gb_seg`\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this method, you will need to also specify **two** variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dictionary containing all the gene or protein names associated with each segment\n",
    "    In the below example, this dictionary object is read from a text file (`hantavirus_segment_dict.txt`)\n",
    "2. Dictionary containing the minimum lengths for each segment sequence\n",
    "    Currently this is hard-coded e.g. \"hantavirus_min_lengths\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The method for processing segments takes the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `gb_file`: string; name of genbank file for a specific virus family or genera\n",
    "2. `working_dir`: string; file path of where you want to save fasta output files\n",
    "3. `virus_family`: string; name of virus family or genera\n",
    "4. `segment_lengths`: dict; similar to min_lengths, but instead need to specifiy the minimum sequence lengths for each segment in the genome\n",
    "5. `segment_names`: dict: the gene or protein names associated with e\n",
    "6. `host_taxafile`: name of text file containing taxonomic names of host of interests e.g. rodentia or shrews.\n",
